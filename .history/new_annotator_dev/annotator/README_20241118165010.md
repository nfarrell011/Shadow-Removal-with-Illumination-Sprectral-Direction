## Image Annotator

This program will allows a user to annotate images and processes the images in real-time into log chromaticity space.

### Usage Instructions:
### ```Step 1```
Clone the repo or download the following files:
* ```annotator_class.py```
* ```image_processor_class.py```
* ```annotator_driver.py ```


### ```Step 2```
Add image folder to the directory containing the image annotator folder
```
base_directory/
├── image_folder_1
├── image_folder_2
├── image_annotator/
│       ├── annotator_class.py
│       ├── image_processor_class.py
│       └── annotator_driver.py.csv
```
Setting the file structure in this way allows for current pathing implementation to execute. Alternatively, the pathing setup can be modified in ```annotator.py``` to the user specifications.

### ```Step 3```
Update ```image_folder``` variable assignment in ```annotator_driver.py``` to the name of the image folder, i.e., ```folder_1```, ```folder_2```, etc.

```python
# UPDATE THIS: This is name of the folder that contains the images to be processed
image_folder = 'test' # Change 'test' to your folder name!
```

### ```Step 4```
Execute ```annotator_driver.py``` 

This GUI will appear:
