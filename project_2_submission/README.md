## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to address image shadow removal using the physics of illumination. This work builds upon prior research by Maxwell et al., who applied the **Bi-Illuminate Dichromatic Reflection (BIDR)** model for shadow removal. The method estimates the **Illumination Spectral Direction (ISD)** of an image in log space and projects the log-space pixels onto a plane orthogonal to the ISD. This projection generates a new **log chromaticity space**, which is invariant to the image's illumination, resulting in shadow-free images.

Our contributions to this problem are twofold:

1. **Data Annotation in the Spectral Dataset:**
   - Identify lit and shadowed pixel pairs in images for training.

2. **Develop a Conversion Program:**  
   - Transform 16-bit `.tiff` image files into **log-space chromaticity** images.

## **Operating System**

- **MacOS** on Apple M1 chip

## **Annotations**

We followed annotation guidelines created by fellow students to complete pixel annotations for the dataset. For detailed documentation, visit the following link:

## **Instructions**

1. **Download** a folder of images from the Spectral Dataset directory on Discovery using the instructions in the documentation linked above.
2. **Save** the folder in the working directory, along with the `log_space_chromaticity.py` script.
3. **Ensure** the annotation `.csv` file is located in the data folder along with the `/done` subdirectory.
4. **Run the script** from the command line:
   ```bash
   python log_space_chromaticity.py path/to/data/dir
5.	**Processed Images**:
    * The processed .tiff files will be saved in the /processed folder within the data directory.
    * A new folder called /chromaticity_results will appear in the working directory, containing comparison images with:
        * Original Image
        * Standard Chromaticity Image
        * Log Space Chromaticity Image
